I am experimenting with using dynamic connectivity to help with Baritone builder 2

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_connectivity

If the experiments in this repo go well, I want to integrate it
into https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/tree/builder-2/src/main/java/baritone/builder (i think MIT is
compatible with LGPL so this is ok)
