/**
 * A better BlockPos that has fewer hash collisions (and slightly more performant offsets)
 * <p>
 * Is it really faster to subclass BlockPos and calculate a hash in the constructor like this, taking everything into account?
 * Yes. 20% faster actually. It's called BETTER BlockPos for a reason. Source:

    // also, if 1.17 sticks with the current plan which is -64 to +320, we could have 9 bits for Y and a constant offset of -64 to change it to -128 to +256.
    // that would result in the packed long representation of any valid coordinate still being a positive integer
    // i like that property, so i will keep num_y_bits at 9 and plan for an offset in 1.17

    // what's this ^ mask for?
    // it allows for efficient offsetting and manipulation of a long packed coordinate
    // if we had three ints, x y z, it would be easy to do "y += 1" or "x -= 1"
    // but how do you do those things if you have a long with x y and z all stuffed into one primitive?
    // adding together two long coordinates actually works perfectly if both sides have X, Y, and Z as all positive, no issues at all
    // but when Y or Z is negative, we run into an issue. consider 8 bits: negative one is 11111111 and one is 00000001
    // adding them together gives 00000000, zero, **but only because there isn't a 9th bit to carry into**
    // if we had, instead, 00000000 11111111 + 00000000 00000001 we would rightly get 00000001 00000000 with the 1 being carried into the 9th position there
    // this is exactly what happens. "toLong(0, 1, 0) + toLong(0, -1, 0)" ends up equaling toLong(1, 0, 0) while we'd rather it equal toLong(0, 0, 0)
    // so, we simply mask out the unwanted result of the carry by inserting 1 bit of padding space (as added above) between each
    // it used to be 000XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXYYYYYYYYYZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    // and now it is 0XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX0YYYYYYYYY0ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    // we simply place the X Y and Z in slightly different sections of the long, putting a bit of space between each
    // the mask ^ is 0111111111111111111111111110111111111011111111111111111111111111
    // using that example of (0,1,0) + (0,-1,0), here's what happens
    //   0000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000 (this is X=0 Y=1 Z=0)
    // + 0000000000000000000000000000111111111000000000000000000000000000 (this is X=0 Y=-1 Z=0)

    // the unwanted carry bit here  ^ is no longer corrupting the least significant bit of X and making it 1!
    // now it's just turning on the unused padding bit that we don't care about
    // using the mask and bitwise and, we can easily and branchlessly turn off the padding bits just in case something overflow carried into them!
    //   0000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000 (the result of the addition from earlier)
