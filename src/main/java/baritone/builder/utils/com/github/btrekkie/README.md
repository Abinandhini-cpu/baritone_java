per https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#Expat

The new license for this modified version (the combined work including my modifications) is still the Baritone license,
which is LGPL.

The git histories of both repos https://github.com/btrekkie/dynamic-connectivity/ and its
dependency https://github.com/btrekkie/RedBlackNode/ have been included by using git's "merge unrelated histories"
feature, so the git blame is accurate for giving credit, I think.
