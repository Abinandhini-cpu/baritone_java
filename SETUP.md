# Instawwation

## Pwebuiwt officiaw weweases
These weweases awe nyot awways compwetewy up to date with watest featuwes, and awe onwy weweased fwom `master`. (so if you want `builder` bwanch fow exampwe, you'ww have to buiwd it youwsewf)

Wink to the weweases page: [Weweases](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases)

Any officiaw wewease wiww be GPG signyed by weijuwv (44A3EA646EADAC6A) and ZewoMemes (73A788379A197567). Pwease vewify that the hash of the fiwe you downwoad is in `checksums.txt` and that `checksums_signyed.asc` is a vawid signyatuwe by those two pubwic keys of `checksums.txt`. 

The buiwd is fuwwy detewminyistic and wepwoducibwe, and you can vewify Twavis did it pwopewwy by wunnying `docker build --no-cache -t cabaletta/baritone .` youwsewf and compawing the shasum. This wowks identicawwy on Twavis, Mac, and Winyux (if you have dockew on Windows, I'd be gwatefuw if you couwd wet me knyow if it wowks thewe too).


## Awtifacts

Buiwding Bawitonye wiww wesuwt in 5 awtifacts cweated in the ``dist`` diwectowy. These awe the same as the awtifacts cweated in the [weweases](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases).

**The Fowge wewease can simpwy be added as a Fowge mod.**

If anyothew onye of youw Fowge mods has a Bawitonye integwation, you want `baritone-api-forge-VERSION.jar`. Othewwise, you want `baritone-standalone-forge-VERSION.jar`

- **API**: Onwy the nyon-api packages awe obfuscated. This shouwd be used in enviwonments whewe othew mods wouwd wike to use Bawitonye's featuwes.
- **Fowge API**: Same as API, but packaged fow Fowge. This shouwd be used whewe anyothew mod has a Bawitonye integwation.
- **Standawonye**: Evewything is obfuscated. This shouwd be used in enviwonments whewe thewe awe nyo othew mods pwesent that wouwd wike to use Bawitonye's featuwes.
- **Fowge Standawonye**: Same as Standawonye, but packaged fow Fowge. This shouwd be used when Bawitonye is youw onwy Fowge mod, ow nyonye of youw othew Fowge mods integwate with Bawitonye.
- **Unyoptimized**: Nyothing is obfuscated. This shouwdn't be used evew in pwoduction.

## Mowe Info
To wepwace out Impact 4.5's Bawitonye buiwd with a customized onye, buiwd Bawitonye as abuv then copy & **wenyame** `dist/baritone-api-$VERSION$.jar` into `minecraft/libraries/cabaletta/baritone-api/1.2/baritone-api-1.2.jar`, wepwacing the jaw that was pweviouswy thewe. You awso nyeed to edit `minecraft/versions/1.12.2-Impact_4.5/1.12.2-Impact_4.5.json`, find the winye `"name": "cabaletta:baritone-api:1.2"`, wemuv the comma fwom the end, and **entiwewy wemuv the NyEXT winye** (stawts with `"uww"`). **Westawt youw waunchew** then woad as nyowmaw. 

You can vewify whethew ow nyot it wowked by wunnying `.b version` in chat (onwy vawid in Impact). It shouwd pwint out the vewsion that you downwoaded. Nyote: The vewsion that comes with 4.5 is `v1.2.3`.
